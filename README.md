# Week 7: Python Data Analysis & Visualization â€“ Iris Dataset

## Objective
This assignment demonstrates basic data analysis and visualization using Python. The primary goal is to:
- Load and explore a dataset using `pandas`
- Perform basic statistical analysis
- Visualize the data using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- 
## Dataset
The Iris dataset was used. It contains measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

Each flower has four features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn (for loading the dataset)
  
## Task 1: Data Loading and Exploration
- Loaded the Iris dataset
- Displayed first few rows
- Checked for missing values and data types

## Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
- Descriptive statistics
- Grouped data by species
- Identified patterns and insights

## Task 3: Data Visualization
- Line chart (mean features per species)
- Bar chart (average petal length by species)
- Histogram (sepal width distribution)
- Scatter plot (sepal length vs. petal length)
